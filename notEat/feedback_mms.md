Points of discussion/recommendations:

- Kudos. Everything is nicely organized and formatted.  Thank you!  
- Kudos. Clean setups for devise and cancancan
- And then I got to app/assets/javascripts  ;)
- Heroku expects your rails app to be at the root dir of your project
  - You can ensure this happens by following these steps:
    - rails new MyIdea # this creates the MyIdea dir
    - cd MyIdea
    - git init
    - Create new empty repo on GitHub (no readme, etc)
      - follow instructions for assigning an existing repo


CFU:
- Many controller actions do not have any code.  How is that?
